Codestellatioin 2020 submission

We designed and built an Arduino circuit and programmed the Arduino to collect values for temperature and sunlight. We then converted the Arduino output data to a Python-comprehendible file to analyze the data for trends in sunlight, temperature and humidity. This analysis is done on a website which we designed through the Dash framework. The collected data is compared with species-specific sunlight requirements and temperature limits attained through Python-based webscraping from reliable botanical databases. The webscraping analysis also provides the user with additional information such as a plants water needs and preferred soil pH ranges. 

Languages Used: C++ (Arduino), Python, JavaScript
